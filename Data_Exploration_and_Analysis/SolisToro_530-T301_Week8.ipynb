Conversely, as sample size decreases, the test is less likely to be positive even if the effect is real. To investigate this behavior, run the tests in this chapter with different subsets of the NSFG data. You can use thinkstats2.SampleRows to select a random subset of the rows in a DataFrame.\n",

    "- Weighted mean height: 170.49 cm\n",
    "- Difference: 1.54 cm\n",
    "This suggests that the unweighted sample underrepresents certain groups, likely those with higher heights. The weighted estimate adjusts for the sampling design, leading to a more accurate representation of the true population mean height.\n",

    "## Standard Error:\n",
    "- Unweighted standard error: 0.0165 cm\n",
    "- Weighted standard error: 0.0368 cm\n",
    "- Difference: 0.0203 cm\n",
    "The weighted standard error is larger, indicating more uncertainty in the weighted estimate compared to the unweighted one. This happens because the weighted analysis takes into account the variability and structure of the survey, including oversampling of certain groups, which can lead to more precise but less consistent estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Confidence Interval:\n",
    "- Unweighted 90% Confidence Interval: [168.93, 168.98]\n",
    "- Weighted 90% Confidence Interval: [170.43, 170.55]\n",
    "The confidence interval for the weighted estimate is wider, reflecting the increased uncertainty around the weighted mean. The difference in the confidence intervals shows that the correct weighting adjusts for the underlying population structure, which can affect both the point estimate and its precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "Correct weighting helps ensure that the estimates you compute reflect the true population values and account for the sampling methodology. If weighting were not used, the estimates might be biased and less representative of the population, particularly in cases of oversampling or underrepresentation."
